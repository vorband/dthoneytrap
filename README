README

  Honeytrap  is  a network security tool written to observe attacks
  against TCP or UDP services. It runs as a daemon and starts serv-
  er  processes dynamically on requested ports. A server emulates a
  well-known service by simply sending captured network traffic  to
  a connected host.

  Many  clients  and particularly attackers will be fooled and send
  responses to a honeytrap server process. The arriving data is as-
  sembled to a string and written to a database file. Such a string
  is called an attack string.

  Honeytrap can parse an attack string for  commands  advising  the
  server  to  download a file from another host. If a download com-
  mand is found, the server tries  to  retrieve  the  corresponding
  file  automatically.  A downloaded file is stored locally with an
  md5 checksum in its name. Currently, only ftp and tftp  are  sup-
  ported.  Honeytrap implements its own clients with the aim to be-
  have as similar as possible than Windows systems. Http  URIs  are
  recognized  and  logged.  A http download routine may be added in
  future releases.

INSTALLATION

  Installation of honeytrap is  pretty straight forward.  Just do a
  './configure  --with-stream-mon=<type> &&  make &&  make install'
  where '<type>' is the connection monitor  type  of  your  choice.
  Please  refer to the INSTALL file and to the output of './config-
  ure --help' for further information.

WARNINGS

  Honeytrap is a low-interactive honeypot and therefore detectable.
  It  is  written  in  C  and thus potentially vulnerable to buffer
  overflow attacks. Take care. Running in mirror mode is dangerous.
  Attacks  may  be directed to the attacker, appearing to come from
  your system. Use with caution.

  The program needs root privileges, but only  for  binding  server
  processes to well-known ports. Use the -u and -g command line op-
  tions to drop privileges and switch to another user and group  as
  early as possible.
